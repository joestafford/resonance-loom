# Resonance Loom - Example Scripts Guide

Welcome to the `examples/` folder of the **Resonance Loom** project! 💜 Here you will find sample output plots generated by running the Resonance Loom tools on both **real EEG data** and **simulated entropy landscapes**.

These examples are provided to:
- Help you understand what successful output looks like
- Showcase different ways Resonance Loom can visualize rest and task entropy dynamics
- Inspire your own explorations and discoveries!

## Example Files

| File Name | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `loom_real_B0701T.png` | Real EEG data (C3 channel) from subject B0701T (BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b). Shows genuine brain activity fluctuations during motor imagery trials. |
| `loom_real_B0903T.png` | Real EEG data (C3 channel) from subject B0903T (BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b). Another authentic EEG session showcasing entropy shifts between rest and task. |
| `loom_simulation_v1.png` | Synthetic entropy landscape simulation. Demonstrates how an idealized entropy field might behave under controlled synthetic "rest" and "task" conditions. |
| `loom_simulation_v2.png` | Second synthetic simulation with slightly different entropy collapse dynamics, highlighting variability and tuning possibilities. |

## How to Interpret These Visuals

- **X-axis**: Trial number (each trial = rest phase + task phase)
- **Y-axis**: Entropy value (higher = more randomness/unpredictability)
- **Blue Line**: Rest Entropy
- **Orange Line**: Task Entropy

See the included infographic "How to Read Resonance Loom Graphs" for a deeper guide! 🖌️

## Generating Your Own Examples

After setting up the repo, you can create similar plots by running:

```bash
python loom_real_data_v2.py --file /path/to/your/file.gdf
```

Or simulate with:

```bash
python loom_simulation_v1.py
python loom_simulation_v2.py
```

Plots will be saved automatically to the `examples/` folder for easy reference.
