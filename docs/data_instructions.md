# EEG Data Instructions ðŸ“œ

The Resonance Loom requires EEG recordings to operate. We used publicly available datasets to weave our first Looms.

## Recommended Dataset: BCIC IV 2b

**Source:**  
[BCI Competition IV, Dataset 2b](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#dataset2b)

**Files Needed:**  
- `.gdf` files such as `B0701T.gdf`, `B0103T.gdf`, `B0502T.gdf`, etc.

**Download Link:**  
You can download the full BCIC IV 2b dataset directly from the [official competition website](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#dataset2b).

**Important Note:**  
The **BCIC IV 2a** dataset did not yield usable trials under our Loom conditions, so we recommend focusing on **2b** for now.

## Folder Structure

Once downloaded, place the `.gdf` files in this structure:
